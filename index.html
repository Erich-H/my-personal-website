            <p>I'm Erich Heiseler, a Junior Software Developer seeking to utilize my strong analytical and programming
                skills to advance my career in the tech field. <!-- make this the header-->
            </p>
            <!-- smaller text about who I am and what I do -->
            <p>My main goal is to work my way towards becoming a Cyber Security Engineer. </br>
                For fun I work on small indie game projects, in terminal text editors and smaller 
                web applications. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Other than coding, I love playing video games, getting coffee with friends, and spending time with 
                family.
